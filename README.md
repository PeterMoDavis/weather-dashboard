# Weather Dashboard

## Description

I built this app so that the user could search a city and find out the current weather for that day in that city, as well as the 5 day forecast. Now no matter where the user is, they can find out the weather at over 200,000 cities all over the world. During the course of developing this app I learned how to call one API and get information to be used in a second API call. I also learned that I really need to start working on my Javascript layout because turning code into a big pile of spaghetti is easier than you think.

You can link to the app [HERE](https://petermodavis.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

## Usage

Just enter the name of the city you'd like to see the current and five day weather forecast for and it will be displayed next to the search bar.
